<center><h2>Course Synopsis</h2></center>
While balancing introductory exposure to and progressive practice with HTML, CSS, GitHub, and Jekyll, the core facets and guiding principles of User Experience, Information Architecture, and interactive design were explored through this course.  A trove of textbooks including *HTML & CSS: Design and Build Websites* by Jon Duckett (ISBN 978-1118008188,) *Don't Make Me Think, Revisited: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability* by Steve Krug (ISBN 978-0321965516,) *Git for Humans* by David Demaree (ISBN 978-1937557386,) and *The Elements of User Experience: User-Centered Design for the Web and Beyond* by Jesse James Garrett (ISBN 978-0321683687) helped to frame this class and focus discussion of situationally appropriate elements.  Particular emphasis was given to designing for accessibility and considering the needs of diverse populations, including appropriate testing methodologies and analysis of web design in library websites.  An impressive series of panels featuring LIS professionals in non-traditional roles as web developers, webmasters, UX/UI designers, and information architecture consultants for major universities and large media companies including Netflix were conducted via the web in this class to help provide context to these concepts and their relevance in the professional world, both specific to, and regardless of a degree in Library and Information Science.

<center><h2>Coursework Samples</h2></center>
Initial assignments in this course covered basic evaluation of websites for common features and flaws, basic coding exercises such as the widely known "Hello World" exercise, and group discussion of frequently accessed websites to help establish a common language and familiarity with the nomenclature of web development.  Both evaluations and exposure to code progressed over the semester and led directly into more complex assignments.

Writing assignments and the evaluation of websites fed into deeper discussions of design concepts and principles.  Culminating in a human research project wherein a battery of usability tests were conducted remotely on volunteers to assess the strengths and weaknesses of a chosen library website.  One artifact of that testing is the following similarity matrix which was derived from the data I obtained conducting card sorting tests to evaluate the taxonomy and efficacy of a website's menu.

We were exposed to the elements of design from start to finish, which included the creation of a "Mood Board" to help portray our general aesthetic ambition or visual design theme for a website we'd be creating as one of our final projects.  My own submitted mood board is available to view here:

Some of the color scheme and "mood" of the images above may seem slightly familiar, as it was one of the formative steps towards my final project for this class, the website you're viewing right now.
