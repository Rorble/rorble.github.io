<center><h2>Combining efforts to maximize community impact in the time of social distancing.</h2></center>
A tremendous result of the work with community partners large and small, the generosity of local farms, and the dedication of volunteers can now be felt and enjoyed by families throughout the triangle as we enter the holiday season this year.  What began as the simple connection between farmers with no viable way to harvest and offload the last portions of seasonal crops amidst COVID-19 restrictions, and small batches of volunteers willing and able to help get fresh produce to area food pantries or families in need rapidly expanded into an operation that has far surpassed any projection for size, scope, and community impact.

Partnering with the Society of St. Andrew, The Change Authority helped to create a network of nearly a dozen farms, food pantries, non-profit agencies, and volunteers to glean, process, transport, and distribute seasonal crops that simply couldn't be moved at a profit this year due to the myriad of health restrictions and decreased demand for short-lived food items this year has brought us.  Fresh produce is a rarity for underprivileged and impoverished communities in any year, yet we have all managed to supply local food pantries with an astounding 22,850 lbs. of Bananas, Blueberries, Broccoli, Corn, Cucumbers, Grapes, Sweet Potatoes, and Watermelon.

This project reached new heights as we connected with triangle YMCA locations to provide the logistical support and food industry connections necessary to facilitate the purchase and distribution of well over 50,000 lbs. of turkeys just in time for the holiday.  These connections will extend well beyond the season as volunteers have now learned to properly glean and process a wide variety of crops.  Local agencies have been shown that it is indeed possible to move large quantities of products when spread across multiple vehicles, and that the larger jobs are no match for easily (and affordably,) rented box trucks and forklifts.  A handful of volunteers, a few phone calls, and a considerable number of donated hours both in the field and behind the wheel managed to bring 73,000 lbs. of food to the tables of those in need this season.  I'd be impressed at any time, but am all the more grateful for the efforts of everyone involved during a profound time of uncertainty for so many out there.

The Change Authority will continue to be here to assist with making connections, providing instruction and insight, and troubleshooting obstacles to non-profit service delivery.  We look forward to where our efforts can next make a difference, and welcome you all to join us as soon as the next opportunity to make a difference presents itself.  Until then, have a lovely holiday season and my sincere thanks for a job well done.
