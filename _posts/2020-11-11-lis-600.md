True to its name, this course provided a broad foundational overview of the interconnected policies of information science, the evolution of the library and its values over time, as well as some of the prescient issues influencing both contemporary and forecasted trends for information professionals.  While heavily expanded upon by personal and professional examples from the professor and class cohort, the content followed much the same format as its primary text *Foundations of Library and Information Science* by Richard E. Rubin (ISBN 978-0838913703).  Discussion of information systems and institutions naturally segued into the history of those complexes as experienced by the Western world.  With some historical context in hand, the course then focused on the values, ethics, policies, and best practices suggested by the American Library Association and the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions.  Particular emphasis was given to the issues of technology bringing change to library and information systems, access considerations, informational freedom, and information science as a customer/human directed service industry.
