<center><h2>Course Synopsis</h2></center>
The principles, policies, and essential concepts of collection management from acquisition through weeding were addressed with a special emphasis on simulated workflows in a collaborative team environment.  Assignments provided tangible experience in the research, design, and implementation of condensed mock collections up to and including the marketing and budgetary considerations necessary to manage such a collection.  Utilizing Peggy Johnson's *Fundamentals of Collection Development and Management* (ISBN 978-0838916414) as our primary text, class discussion followed the general order prescribed by the source material.  Special topics and discussion emerged throughout the semester, such as the surge in priority (not always relative to popularity) of ebooks, audiobooks, and digital content at a time in history when the future physical to digital ratio of collection items remains uncertain due to the altered business practices and unknown variables imposed by COVID-19.  Ethical considerations for what can and should not be included in a collection were handled in a clear, pragmatic, and business-minded fashion.  Real world examples of academic, public, and special collections were highlighted by both the professor and guest speakers to provide context to discussions and answer questions.

<center><h2>Coursework Samples</h2></center>
Classroom conversations carried over into deeper analysis of pertinent topics in an online forum through graded discussion boards.  Topics were often initially raised or inspired by other students through presentations throughout the semester when small groups were expected to review assigned chapters of the text and reframe the concepts introduced alongside modern examples and related concepts each week.  All other assignments were directly related to one another and continued to grow in scope over the course of the semester.  Our first large group assignment was an environmental scan of a real world library both to grant us exposure to the practice, and to help us assess areas of emergent or ongoing need for the library system selected.  It was the responsibility of each student to identify a gap in coverage or specialization for the library researched, and build a small sample collection that would fill this perceived gap.  My own contribution was an Asian Literature collection for a public library, presented in the form of a website linked below:

When all group members had created a mini-collection aimed to improve the accessibility or representation of our chosen library's overall collection, we were tasked with joining elements of our environmental scan and LibGuide or website representations of mini-collections into a unified digital presentation.  Once complete, the group had to again work together to decide upon a marketing theme that would serve every collection, and design marketing materials or events to promote the fictional assemblage of special collections.  As our group of collections had identified a number of underserved demographics and designed collections to address this, my concept of "Find Your Story" was selected as the faux library slogan.  A drive-in movie festival promotion I conceived was also chosen by the group to be our representative joint event.  I then designed a pair of web banners that could be printed on either side of a bookmark for promotional purposes, pictured below:

As I still needed a marketing aid to promote my own mini-collection, I also produced the following poster:

Our final group project was a five year plan for the management of our fake library, to include acquisition, budget, weeding, and promotional/development considerations.  This was very much a group effort and emphasized the role of collaboration and distributed responsibilities in the realm of administrative library processes.
